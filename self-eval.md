# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
It was a little scary at first but I was able to find a post on stack overflow that got me through it! It felt good to be able to read
someone else's code/ solution and have some sort of idea what was going on.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
It's going well, it helps to work with partners and set mutual breaks and come back together. Staying focused can still be a struggle
but I'm using do not disturb on my phone and setting aside other things. Also making a personal to do list
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
I continued to push through challenges and resist pulling away or giving up when faced with something I don't know.
